To make the application we choose to use <strong>Ionic and Cordova</strong> for the conversion to an APK file and the interface and <strong>Angular</strong> for the interface. The grades are stored in<strong> Airtable</strong>, a CMS that allows you to easily build a database and an API, because we don&rsquo;t want to make the back-end.</p>\n<p class=\"mt-2\"><em>Process :</em> for this project the concept was imposed, so we started by a <strong>brainstorming to choose wich functionality</strong> we wanted for our application, how to store the data&#8230; we choose to make a protection and connexion by student ID to protect the grades, add a PDF report generator, a page with the profil of the student : picture, name&#8230;, and a page with some statistics. Then we import the excel file that we have in Airtable and we add the photo. And finally, after an equitable <strong>tasks&rsquo;s distribution</strong> , we generate the template, set up a github and start writing code.</p>\n",

We was a <strong>team of two</strong> to do this project.</p>\n<p class=\"mt-2\"><em>Process :</em> to begin we <strong>make a map</strong> of the room that we want to do with all the elements. Then, we make a huge array with all the 3D models we have to do, with their dimensions ,the person in charge of modeling and some inspiration&rsquo;s picture to agree on the style. After we <strong>have modeling</strong> a lot and show each other our creation to validate them. Finally, we export all in a Collada File and <strong>import it in ThreeJS</strong>. Finally we <strong>add all the interactions</strong> : drawers that open, books that move, music, lights&#8230; and we do a little adjustments to the initial interface to make it more pretty.</p>\n",

By example, when you search « world war 2 » the application will gave you a timeline with all the events of the database who is in relation to this term. At the end we wanted our application to be self-suffisant : the events was take to Wikipedia through Wikipedia&rsquo;s API and the user help too by contributing. We was a <strong>team of three</strong> and I take care of a big part of the development.</p>\n<p class=\"mt-2\">It was one of our teacher&rsquo;s idea, and with the idea come a constraint : <strong>WordPress.</strong> So we use WordPress with CPTUI (Custom Post UI) and ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) to create personalized type of contents, and a JS library, <strong>TimelineJS</strong> to show the event as a timeline. As TimelineJS takes data as JSON, we use WordPress REST API to retrieve the content and a<strong> PHP script</strong> to transform the JSON into a good format. It&rsquo;s maybe not the good way to do it but finally the research works, it return a timeline and the users can contribute.</p>\n<p class=\"mt-2\"><em>Process :</em> We started the process of creation by a long period of philosophical reflection : what represent an event, what type of event exists, if we have a lot of event how to choose witch one to show&#8230; to conceive our database. Then come an other period of reflection : how to represent the timeline (vertically/horizontally), how to represent the beginning of a period of time, how to represent an event with an imprecise date&#8230; to design the website. And in parallel we think of the marketing, the communication, the budget&#8230; Then the realization : we first made a static landing page, to talk about the project and the functionality, and finally we developed the application.</p>\n",
